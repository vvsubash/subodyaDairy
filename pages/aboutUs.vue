    <p>
      We are multigeneration dairy farmers who take pride not only in quality of
      milk we produce but also in way which we produce it we form a deep bond
      with the animals, farmland &amp; community surrounding it to produce milk
      that is second to none.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milk we produce is 100% organic we would never use any chemical to enhance
      production of milk or texture of milk or to enhance shelf life of our
      milk. we would rather sell less quantity of milk with higher standards
      than otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have started our dairy from single cow and had it grown from it what it
      is today.
